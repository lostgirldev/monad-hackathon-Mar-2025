### Code Analysis

#### 1. Bug Identification

*   **File:** `filtermanager/drive.go`
    ```go
    func (d *DriveLoader) Load() ([]string, error) {
        resource := []string{}
        for _, source := range d.sources {
            d.wg.Add(1)
            go func(source string) {
                directURL := d.getGoogleDriveDirectURL(source)
                res, err := d.loadSource(directURL)
                if err == nil {
                    resource = append(resource, res...)
                } else {
                    d.logger.Error().Msgf("Error downloading file: %v\n", err)
                }
                d.wg.Done()
            }(source)

        }

        d.wg.Wait()
        return resource, nil
    }
    ```

    **Problem:** There's a data race on the `resource` variable. Multiple goroutines are appending to the same slice without any synchronization mechanisms (like a mutex). This can lead to lost updates and incorrect results. This is especially problematic because the `resource` slice is returned, and its contents might be incomplete or corrupted due to the race condition.

*   **File:** `filtermanager/filtermodel/filterparams.go`
    ```go
    func SetResource(resource []string) {
        _resource = resource
    }
    ```
    **Problem:** There is a data race on the `_resource` variable. Multiple goroutines can potentially access and modify the global `_resource` slice concurrently without any locking mechanism. This can cause unpredictable behavior and data corruption. `SetResource` function is likely called during the initialization phase, and if any concurrent process tries to access `_resource`, it could lead to runtime error.

#### 2. Comprehensiveness/Completeness Analysis

The codebase provides a reasonable structure for a bad word filtering system. It includes:

*   Configuration (`config.go`):  Basic configuration for replacement characters.
*   Filter Management (`filtermanager`): Core logic for loading resources and filtering text.  Defines interfaces for resource loaders and the filter controller.
*   Resource Loaders (`resourceloader`): Implementations for loading bad words from different sources (Google Sheets, Google Drive).  GitHub and Firebase are stubbed out.
*   Filter Model (`filtermodel`): Contains the filtering logic and data structures.
*   Common Helpers (`common/helper`): Utility function for creating strings.
*   Tests (`_test`): A basic test case.

However, there are areas for improvement:

*   **Error Handling:**  While errors are returned in some functions, the handling is not always consistent.  For example, in `FilterEvent.GetAll`, the error from `params.GetAll()` is ignored.
*   **Missing Resource Loaders:** The GitHub and Firebase resource loaders are missing implementations.
*   **Configuration:** More robust configuration options (e.g., case sensitivity, whole word matching) could be added.
*   **Logging:**  The Google Sheets loader uses `zerolog`, but other parts of the code don't have logging. Consistent logging would be beneficial.
*   **Testing:** More comprehensive tests are needed, especially for different resource loaders and edge cases.  The current test is minimal and relies on a Google Sheet.
*   **Security:** The current Google Sheets implementation requires API Key directly in code. Storing sensitive info in the code is insecure.

#### 3. Architecture Analysis (Monad-Related Components)

The code does not use monad-related components.

## Readme vs Code Report
```markdown
## Documentation vs. Codebase Analysis

Here's an analysis of how much of the documentation is implemented in the codebase and what's missing:

**Implemented Features:**

*   **Bad Word Filtering:** The core functionality of filtering bad words is implemented. The code includes functions for replacing and identifying bad words in a given text.
*   **Multiple Data Sources:**
    *   **Google Sheets:** The `resourceloader/ggsheet.go` file implements the `resourceloader.ResourceLoader` interface and provides functionality to load bad words from a Google Sheet.  The `NewSheetsLoader` function aligns with the documented example.
    *   **Google Drive:** The `resourceloader/drive.go` file implements the `resourceloader.ResourceLoader` interface and provides functionality to load bad words from a Google Drive.  The `NewDriveLoader` function is implemented.
*   **Concurrent Processing:** The `GetAllAsync` and `ReplaceAllAsync` methods in `filtermanager/manager.go` use goroutines, suggesting that concurrent processing is implemented.
*   **Configurable Filtering Options:**
    *   The `badwordfilter.ReplaceCharacters` variable in `config.go` allows customization of the replacement character.  This is documented with an example.
*   **Thread-safe operations:** The implementation of async functions use goroutines and channels that make them thread safe.
*   **Comprehensive logging:** The Google Sheets loader uses zerolog, which supports comprehensive logging. The Drive loader also uses zerolog for logging errors.

**Missing/Partially Implemented Features:**

*   **GitHub Data Source:** There is a file `filtermanager/resourceloader/github.go`, but its content is empty. This indicates that the GitHub data source functionality is **not implemented**.
*   **Firebase Data Source:** There is a file `filtermanager/resourceloader/firebase.go`, but its content is empty. This indicates that the Firebase data source functionality is **not implemented**.
*   **Configuration:** The documentation describes a Google Sheets setup, this is implemented.

**Code Quality/Completeness Observations:**

*   **Error Handling:** Error handling appears to be present in the Google Sheets loader, the Drive loader and in the filter manager to check resource emptiness.
*   **Testing:** A basic test case (`_test/filter_test.go`) exists, exercising the Google Sheets loader and `ContainsBadWords` functionality.  However, comprehensive testing of all data sources and filtering options would be beneficial.
*   **Configuration:** The documentation shows how to configure Google Sheets.
