## Buggyness and Architecture Report

### Code Analysis

1.  **Bug Identification:**

    *   **Problem:** In `src/blockbolt.ts`, the `writeContract` method is being called with `request` object directly. `writeContract` expects a function name, arguments, and value. `request` is a complex object containing all these, but `writeContract` does not unpack it automatically.

    *   **Problematic Code:**

    ```typescript
          // Send the transaction
          const hash = await this.walletClient.writeContract(request);
    ```

    *   **Description:**  The `writeContract` function from `viem` is used incorrectly. It should be invoked with the `functionName` and `args` separately, not with the entire request object. The `request` object from `simulateContract` *does* contain the necessary information, but `writeContract` doesn't implicitly unpack it. We need to destructure the relevant properties and call `writeContract` correctly. We also need to provide the `account` from which to send the transaction.

    *   **Corrected Code (suggested):**

        ```typescript
              // Send the transaction
              const hash = await this.walletClient.writeContract({
                  account,
                  address: this.contractAddress,
                  abi: BLOCKBOLT_MONAD_ABI,
                  functionName: request.functionName,
                  args: request.args,
                  value: request.value,
              });
        ```

2.  **Comprehensiveness/Completeness Analysis:**

    The codebase provides a basic structure for interacting with a BlockBolt smart contract. It includes:

    *   Contract interaction logic in `blockbolt.ts`.
    *   Type definitions in `src/types/index.ts`.
    *   Chain and contract address constants in `src/constants/chain.ts`.
    *   ABI definition in `src/constants/abi/blockboltABI.ts`.
    *   Validation utilities in `src/utils/validation.ts`.
    *   Custom error classes in `src/utils/errors.ts`.
    *   Example usage in `src/examples/index.ts` (currently empty).

    However, the completeness is questionable.

    *   The code lacks comprehensive error handling.  While it catches errors during transaction submission and status retrieval, it could benefit from more granular error handling and logging.
    *   The `examples/index.ts` file is empty, indicating that example usage is not yet implemented.  This significantly reduces the usability of the SDK.
    *   There are no unit tests.
    *   The validation is pretty basic.

3.  **Monad-Related Architecture Analysis:**

    The code does not use monad-related components in a functional programming sense (e.g., Maybe/Option, Either/Result monads).  The term "Monad" in the context of the `MONAD_TESTNET` chain is simply a name and does not imply the use of monadic programming principles within the SDK's architecture.

## Readme vs Code Report
## Analysis of BlockBolt Monad Wallet SDK Documentation vs. Codebase

Here's an analysis of the BlockBolt Monad Wallet SDK documentation, comparing it to the provided codebase, highlighting implemented and missing aspects.

```markdown
### Implemented Features

*   **Basic Payment SDK:** The core functionality of a simple payment SDK for the Monad blockchain using BlockBolt is implemented. The `BlockBolt` class provides methods for `makePayment`, `getTransactionStatus`, and `getExplorerUrl`.
*   **Decentralized Transactions:** The code facilitates direct interaction with the Monad blockchain without intermediaries.  The `BlockBolt` class uses `viem` to interact directly with the Monad blockchain.
*   **Blockchain-Verified Transactions:** The `makePayment` function facilitates recording transactions on the Monad blockchain, and `getTransactionStatus` allows retrieval of on-chain transaction data.
*   **Viem Integration:**  The SDK heavily relies on `viem` for blockchain interactions.  It uses `viem`'s `createPublicClient`, `createWalletClient`, `parseEther`, and account handling.
*   **Full Transaction Receipt Access:** The `getTransactionStatus` method returns the full transaction receipt.
*   **Explorer URL Generation:** The `getExplorerUrl` method generates the correct URL using the `MONAD_TESTNET` configuration.
*   **Error Handling:** The SDK includes custom error classes (`BlockBoltSDKError`, `TransactionError`) and uses try/catch blocks to handle potential errors during transaction execution.  The `validatePaymentDetails` function also provides error handling.

### Partially Implemented Features

*   **QR Code Payments:** The documentation mentions QR code payments as a feature to prevent phishing and wallet-draining attacks, but there is no specific code implementation or functionality for directly generating or handling QR codes in the provided codebase. It's likely this refers to using the generated payment details to create a QR code externally, and the SDK handles the payment processing itself.

### Missing Features

*   **Order Details Storage:** The documentation states, "order details are stored directly on the Monad blockchain".  The provided `transfer` function stores `orderId`, `merchantName` and `merchantAddress` but the actual order information isn't stored in a dedicated, easily retrievable structure on the blockchain. The ABI contains an `getOrder` method. However, this functionality is not exposed through the BlockBolt class.
*   **Custom Events in ABI:** The ABI includes events related to Ownership, Pausing, Token Transfers, and Withdrawals. However, there are no methods in the `BlockBolt` class to leverage or expose these events, or handle functionalities such as Pausing, withdrawing, etc. These indicate features the BlockBolt contract *supports*, but which this SDK does not *expose*.

### Code Structure and Completeness

*   **`blockbolt.ts`:** Contains the core `BlockBolt` class with the main SDK methods.
*   **`constants/chain.ts`:** Defines the Monad Testnet chain configuration and contract address.
*   **`constants/abi/blockboltABI.ts`:** Contains the ABI of the BlockBolt contract.
*   **`types/index.ts`:** Defines the `PaymentDetails` and `TransactionResult` interfaces.
*   **`utils/validation.ts`:** Implements validation for payment details.
*   **`utils/errors.ts`:** Defines custom error classes.
*   **`index.ts`:** Exports all relevant modules.
*   **`examples/index.ts`:** empty file.

### Recommendations

*   **Implement QR Code functionality:** Add methods to generate QR codes or integrate with a QR code library.
*   **Implement Order Details retrieval** Add a method `getOrderDetails` that will fetch from the contract an order based on the `orderId` passed in, since the smart contract has the functionality of fetching an order
*   **Address Missing Functionalities:** Evaluate the necessity of functionalities related to the events in the ABI (Ownership, Pausing, etc.) and implement them if required.
*   **Add Examples:** Populate `examples/index.ts` with usage examples.
